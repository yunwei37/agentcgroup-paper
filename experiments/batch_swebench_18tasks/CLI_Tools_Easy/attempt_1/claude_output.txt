Perfect! Let me create a comprehensive summary:

## Summary

I've successfully fixed the issue where pyupgrade was too eagerly transforming `"<separator>".join(shlex.quote(...))` to `shlex.join(...)` even when the separator was not a single space.

### The Problem
The original code was transforming:
```python
"garbage".join(shlex.quote(a) for a in ["some", "quotable strings"])
```
to:
```python
shlex.join(["some", "quotable strings"])
```

This is incorrect because `shlex.join()` always uses a space as the separator, while the original code uses `"garbage"` as the separator. These are not equivalent.

### The Solution
Added a single check in `/testbed/pyupgrade/_plugins/shlex_join.py` (line 43) to verify that the join separator is exactly a single space `" "`:

```python
node.func.value.value == ' ' and
```

This ensures the transformation only occurs when it's semantically valid.

### Testing
- ✅ All 8 shlex_join tests pass (including 2 new test cases)
- ✅ Full test suite passes: 978 passed, 4 xfailed
- ✅ Verified the fix with the exact example from the issue
- ✅ Verified that valid transformations (with space separator) still work correctly

### Changes Made
1. **pyupgrade/_plugins/shlex_join.py**: Added condition `node.func.value.value == ' '` to check that the separator is a single space
2. **tests/features/shlex_join_test.py**: Added 2 test cases to prevent regression:
   - Non-space separator case: `"garbage".join(shlex.quote(...))`
   - Comma-space separator case: `", ".join(shlex.quote(...))`
