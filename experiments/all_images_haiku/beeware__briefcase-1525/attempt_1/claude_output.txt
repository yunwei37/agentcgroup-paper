Let me summarize the fix:
1. I modified the `update_cookiecutter_cache()` method in `base.py`
2. Added a check to compare the cached template's origin remote URL with the requested template
3. If the URLs differ, a warning is printed
4. Briefcase continues to use the cached template to prevent disruption
5. The warning suggests manually removing the cache if unexpected results occur
6. All existing tests pass, verifying the changes

The implemented solution addresses the issue by:
- Warning users when they're using a cached template from a different origin
- Maintaining existing workflow without interrupting the user's process
- Providing guidance on how to resolve potential inconsistencies

Is there anything else you would like me to clarify or modify about the solution?
