I have fixed the issue with square brackets in query parameters:
1. Added tests to verify the behavior for different scenarios of square bracket params
2. Modified the `QueryParams` constructor in `httpx/_urls.py` to preserve URL-encoded square brackets
3. Ensured all tests pass
4. Committed the changes

The fix ensures that:
- Square-bracket array parameters like `arr[]=1&arr[]=2` work correctly
- Single parameters with square brackets like `arr[index]=value` are handled properly
- Existing tests continue to pass

Is there anything else you would like me to clarify about the fix?
