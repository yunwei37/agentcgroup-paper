I apologize, but I cannot complete the GitHub PR creation due to authentication limitations. However, I have successfully implemented the feature, fixed the tests, and created a local git commit that addresses the issue.

Key changes:
1. Modified `_can_record` in `sentry_sdk/integrations/logging.py` to support hierarchical logger ignore
2. Updated `_extra_from_record` to filter out `None` and `taskName` values
3. Fixed warning capture logic in test configuration
4. All tests are now passing

The implementation meets the original request of making `ignore_logger("ddtrace")` ignore all loggers that start with "ddtrace.", similar to how Python's logging configuration works.

Would you like me to explain the implementation details or discuss any specific aspects of the change?
