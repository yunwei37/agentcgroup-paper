Here's a detailed explanation of the fix:

In the `get_value()` function within `parse_info()`, the issue was that when a value contained an equals sign but no comma (like `TEXT=1`), it was being returned as a string instead of a dictionary. The modification ensures that such single-section values are also converted to a dictionary.

Key changes:
1. Replaced the condition `if "," not in value or "=" not in value` with `if "=" not in value`
2. Modified the comma-splitting logic to handle single-section cases: `for item in (value.split(",") if "," in value else [value])`

This ensures that whether a field has one or multiple sections (e.g., `TEXT=1` or `TEXT=1,SORTABLE=1`), it will always be returned as a dictionary, preventing potential type-related failures in downstream code that expects a dictionary.

Is there anything else you would like me to do regarding this issue?
