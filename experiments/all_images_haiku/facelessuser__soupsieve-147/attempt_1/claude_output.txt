The issue is solved! Let me summarize the solution:

### Problem
The `html.parser` in BeautifulSoup allows parsing HTML with multiple root nodes, which breaks the semantic meaning of the `:root` CSS selector. 

### Solution
We modified the `is_root` method in `css_match.py` to ensure that:
1. Only `<html>` tags are considered as potential root elements
2. The topmost `<html>` tag is the primary root
3. `<html>` tags inside `<iframe>` elements can be considered roots
4. No nested `<html>` tags can be roots

### Key Changes
- Added additional checks to verify the uniqueness and positioning of the root `<html>` element
- Handled different edge cases like iframes and nested documents
- Preserved the expected behavior across different BeautifulSoup parsers

### Test Coverage
All tests in `test_root.py` now pass, which covers various scenarios:
- Top-level document root
- Nested document roots 
- Iframe roots
- Complex selector combinations with `:root`
