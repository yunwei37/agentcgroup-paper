I apologize, but it seems like the issue description is missing from your message. Could you please provide the specific issue you would like me to fix? I'll be happy to help you through the full workflow you've outlined, but I need more details about the problem to get started.

To proceed, I'll need you to share:
- A description of the issue 
- Any error messages
- Specifics about the expected behavior versus the current behavior

Once you provide those details, I'll systematically work through the steps you've described to resolve the issue.
