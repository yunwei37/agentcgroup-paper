Now I'll explain the changes:

I've implemented stdin support for the `files-to-prompt` CLI tool. This allows users to pipe file lists from other tools like `find` or `fd` using the new `--stdin` flag. 

Key changes:
- Added `--stdin` option to CLI 
- Updated argument parsing to support optional paths
- Process file paths from stdin, skipping comments and empty lines
- Added robust error handling for various stdin scenarios
- Created comprehensive tests to validate stdin functionality
- Handles mixing stdin and command-line paths
- Provides informative error messages for invalid inputs

The implementation matches the feature request example:
`fd --full-path 'some/path/.*\.md' --exclude='some-huge-file\.md' | uvx files-to-prompt --stdin | llm --system "Generate code for x, y, z"`

The feature is now complete and all tests are passing.
