Read and understand the issue thoroughly\n2. Explore the codebase to find relevant files\n3. Implement the fix\n4. Run the test suite to verify your fix\n5. If ANY test fails, analyze the error and fix it\n6. Repeat steps 4-5 until ALL tests pass\n7. Only stop when tests are passing\n\nDO NOT stop until you have:\n- Made code changes that fix the issue\n- Run the tests and confirmed they pass\n- Shown the final git diff\n\nIf you encounter test failures, debug and fix them. Keep trying until successful.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING:\n- You MUST run the project's ORIGINAL test suite (pytest, unittest, tox, etc.)\n- Do NOT write custom test scripts or verification scripts to bypass tests\n- Do NOT claim success based on your own All"},"uuid":"46652a47-fe3e-401a-9339-a748d7539ef2","timestamp":"2026-02-07T00:11:56.860Z"}
