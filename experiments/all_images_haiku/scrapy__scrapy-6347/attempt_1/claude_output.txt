Here's a summary of the fix:
- Set `METAREFRESH_IGNORE_TAGS` to an empty list by default in `default_settings.py`
- This allows the default behavior to find and follow meta refresh tags even in `<noscript>` tags 
- All tests are now passing, indicating the fix matches the expected behavior

The implementation follows the discussion in https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3844, where the default should allow discovering meta refresh tags in any context, addressing potential antibot behaviors.
