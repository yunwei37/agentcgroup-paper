Here's a summary of the changes:
1. Updated urllib3 Retry configuration to work with 2.0.0
2. Added `ssl_minimum_version` to enforce TLS 1.2
3. Passed retry configuration explicitly to PoolManager
4. Fixed warning handling in test initialization
5. Added changelog entry documenting the changes

The migration ensures compatibility with urllib3 2.0.0 while maintaining existing functionality. The OpenSSL support is now enforced with TLS 1.2 as the minimum version, and the Retry mechanism has been updated to work with the latest urllib3 version.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of the changes or do you have any further questions about the urllib3 migration?
