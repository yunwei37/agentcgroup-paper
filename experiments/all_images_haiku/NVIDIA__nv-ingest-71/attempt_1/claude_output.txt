I'll summarize the fix and proposed next steps:

I fixed the issue with tiny images by adding a minimum size check before processing in the PDFium image extraction method. This prevents processing of (1, 1, 1) arrays that were causing conversion errors.

Key changes in `/testbed/src/nv_ingest/extraction_workflows/pdf/pdfium_helper.py`:
```python
# Skip tiny images
min_width = 4  # adjust as needed
min_height = 4  # adjust as needed
if image_numpy.shape[0] < min_width or image_numpy.shape[1] < min_height:
    logger.warning(f"Skipping tiny image of size {image_numpy.shape}")
    continue
```

Remaining tasks:
1. Create test PDF files for the test suite
2. Complete dependency installation
3. Run full test suite

Would you like me to create the test PDF files or proceed with another approach to testing?
