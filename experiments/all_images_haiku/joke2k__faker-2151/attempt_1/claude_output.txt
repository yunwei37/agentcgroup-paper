The issue is now fixed. Let me explain the solution:

The problem was in the `date_time_between` method where the random number generation was not consistently reproducible when resetting the seed. The key changes are:

1. Create a new random generator using the current state of the generator: 
```python
current_seed = self.generator.random.getstate()
rand_for_ts = random_module.Random()
rand_for_ts.setstate(current_seed)
```

2. Use this local random generator to generate the timestamp instead of the global random generator.

3. Added platform-specific handling to match the original behavior on Windows vs. other systems.

This ensures that:
- Each time the seed is reset, the generator produces the exact same sequence of random dates
- The behavior is consistent across different platforms
- The original functionality is preserved

This fix will help users who rely on reproducible random date generation, such as in testing scenarios or simulations where consistent random data is important.
