I'll summarize the changes:

I fixed the KeyError issue in the FancyLists extension by adding safety checks in the `get_items()` method of the `pymdownx/fancylists.py` file. The modifications prevent IndexError/KeyError exceptions when processing list items that lack an explicit list number but have a `.` or `)` separator.

Key changes:
- Added checks to verify `items` list is not empty before accessing the last item
- Added fallback logic to append items when the list is initially empty
- Maintained the existing parsing logic while preventing unhandled exceptions

The fix allows parsing of markdown lists like:
```markdown
1. foo
. bar

1) foo
) bar
```

All 48 test cases in the test suite passed after the modification. The commit resolves the issue while preserving the existing behavior of the FancyLists markdown extension.

Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this fix?
