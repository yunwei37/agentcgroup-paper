Let me explain the fix:

The issue was with parsing "CHARACTER VARYING" type in PostgreSQL dialect. I added additional token mappings for "CHARACTER VARYING" with and without parentheses to ensure correct parsing. 

The tokenizer now recognizes these variations:
- "CHARACTER VARYING"
- "CHARACTER VARYING("
- "CHARACTER VARYING ("

This modification ensures that the parser correctly handles the "character varying" type declaration, which is equivalent to VARCHAR in PostgreSQL.

I ran the PostgreSQL dialect tests, and they all passed, confirming that the fix resolves the parsing error while maintaining compatibility with existing tests.

The original SQL statement with "character varying" should now parse correctly:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION function_name (input_a character varying DEFAULT NULL::character varying)
```

Would you like me to explain anything further about the fix?
