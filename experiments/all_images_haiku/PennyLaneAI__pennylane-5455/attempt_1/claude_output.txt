The issue is related to how Hamiltonians are constructed and evolved in PennyLane version 0.35.1. The key differences are:
1. `qml.dot()` seems to queue gates correctly
2. Direct operator arithmetic (`+`) queues extra gates 
3. The problem can be fixed by `qml.operation.enable_new_opmath()`

Let's investigate the PennyLane source code:
