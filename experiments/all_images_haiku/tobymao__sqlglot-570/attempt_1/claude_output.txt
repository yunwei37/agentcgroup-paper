Let me summarize the solution:

1. I added support for the `NOTNULL` keyword in SQLGlot
2. Modified `tokens.py` to recognize `NOTNULL` and map it to the `IS` token type
3. Updated the `_parse_is` method in `parser.py` to handle `NOTNULL` by treating it like `IS NULL`, but negating the result
4. Tested the changes by parsing a query that uses `NOTNULL`
5. Committed the changes to the repository

The key changes ensure that `NOTNULL` is now a valid keyword in SQLGlot, equivalent to `IS NOT NULL`, which maintains the original semantics while expanding parsing flexibility.

Is there anything else you would like me to do with this implementation?
